RandomizerGUI.goUpdateMovesLegacyCheckBox.toolTipText=<html>Instead of updating moves to their Gen 6 stats, update them to their Gen 5 stats instead.<br />This is intended for people who used the "Update Moves" function in old randomizers but don't like the new changes.<br />This is available for every game except Gen 5 games where it would be pointless.
RandomizerGUI.pbsStandardEXPCurvesCB.text=Standardize EXP Curves
RandomizerGUI.pbsStandardEXPCurvesCB.toolTipText=<html>When this is selected, every Pokemon's EXP curve will be changed to one of the following:<ul><li>Medium Fast (1,000,000 EXP to Level 100) if it isn't a legendary<li>Slow (1,250,000 EXP to Level 100) if it is.</ul>This will cause Pokemon to be better or worse based more on their stats/moves/type rather than the difficulty of leveling them.<br /><b>WARNING: This will break trade compatibility with ROMs that don't have this option enabled. Use with caution.</b>
RandomizerGUI.pms4MovesCB.toolTipText=<html>Check this to make sure every Pokemon gets 4 moves at level 1, instead of them keeping their original move count.<br />This ensures that every Pokemon you catch will have a full moveset.<br />This is now available for all supported games.

CodeTweaksDialog.bwPatchCB.text=B/W Exp Patch
CodeTweaksDialog.bwPatchCB.toolTipText=<html>Select this to patch the game you are randomizing to use the Black/White new XP gain system.<br />This system gives EXP in a different way, rewarding players for beating higher level Pokemon with lower levels.<br />This is currently available only for English R/B/Y and G/S/C.
CodeTweaksDialog.nerfXAccCB.text=Nerf X Accuracy
CodeTweaksDialog.nerfXAccCB.toolTipText=<html>X Accuracy in Generation 1 games is a pretty broken item, given that it gives 100% accuracy to any and all moves used.<br />Apply this code tweak to stop X Accuracy from working on sleep moves, trapping moves & one-hit KO moves.<br />Doing this means that the player cannot use X Accuracy and lock the opponents into infinite sleep/Wrap, nor can they just use one-hit KO moves on everything.<br />Applying this patch will also remove the one-hit KO moves from the "broken moves" list if you use that option, since they aren't really broken without X Accuracy.<br /><b>Credit to Mountebank for this patch.</b>
CodeTweaksDialog.critRateFixCB.text="Fix" Crit Rate
CodeTweaksDialog.critRateFixCB.toolTipText=<html>Selecting this option will "fix" Generation 1's critical hit rate to be the same as the other games (1/16), instead of being based on Speed.<br />Focus Energy and Dire Hit will also be fixed to increase crit rate instead of decreasing it.<br />"High crit rate" moves such as Slash will have double the normal crit chance, like in later games.
